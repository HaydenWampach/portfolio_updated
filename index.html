      <p>My name is Hayden Wampach! I was born and raised in Camas, WA until I was 18 years old. After high school I attended Washington State University where I study Mechanical Engineering</p>

      <p>After college I went on to pursue a career in the mortgage industry. I currently work for Pacific Mortgage Planning as a Loan Officer and Operations Manager for a small brokerage firm. Although I am excited about the mortgage industry, I am also ready to pursue a different career path as a computer programer.</p>

      <p>Currently I am studying computer coding at University of Washington through their coding bootcamp program. I have learned a great deal in the past few months through the program and can not wait to see what else the course will teach us.</p>
